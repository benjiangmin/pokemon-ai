# pokemon-ai

The **goal** of this project is to create a website that can handle lots of user requests relating to pokemon. The main focus is to use AI to generate responses, use data from the PokeAPI, and to put it all on a visually pleasing, easily accesible website for all to use. Of course there are more details and utilities I'd like to include, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

The **MVP** of this would be to generate a list of pokemon, using AI, that fits the user's prompt. For example, if a user said, "Give me red-ish pokemon from generation 5 that have a speed stat greater than 100", and the website would respond accordingly. 

The **nice to haves** are many and will probably continue to grow. I would like:
1. 3d models for each pokemon
2. essentially create...a pokedex, honestly.
3. visually pleasing user interface
4. umm yeah
